# Deploy the latest to this prod server via docker compose: pull, rebuild the
# images, roll the stack (db + api), apply the SQL migrations, then verify
# /healthz. Unlike lm-dashboard, the api does NOT create the schema on startup --
# server/db/migrations/ is the source of truth and is applied here (every file is
# idempotent via IF NOT EXISTS, so re-running the whole loop is safe). Refuses to
# run over uncommitted changes to tracked files -- commit, stash, or discard them
# first so a pull never silently clobbers edits.
#
# The proactive trigger daemon runs in-process inside the api (gated by
# TRIGGER_DAEMON_ENABLED), so there is no separate daemon service to roll.
#
# The client is a static Vite build served by nginx from client/dist, not by the
# api. This script does not rebuild it; `make deploy` runs `npm --prefix client ci`
# and `npm --prefix client run build` after it.
#
# Prereqs on this host: Docker + the compose v2 plugin, and a `.env` with
# POSTGRES_PASSWORD and the app secrets (see .env.example).
