-- 011_student_identity.sql
-- Wires the (previously dormant) identity-switch slice onto a live path.
-- Tracks the last-seen spelling + classCode per canonical student, advancing only
-- forward in event time. On each proactive tick the daemon compares a student's
-- newest event identity against this last-seen row; a change records a switch_events
-- row (009) via detect_switches. Forward-only advance makes it idempotent and stops
-- the two spellings of one student from oscillating a switch every tick.
