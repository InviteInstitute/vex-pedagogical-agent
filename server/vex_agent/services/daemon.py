"""Always-on background daemon for the proactive push lane (spec §5.2, §8).

Runs in a thread (not an asyncio task) because run_proactive_tick's psycopg / urllib /
openai calls are blocking and would stall the event loop. Each tick: sync logs, then
for every student with recent telemetry, run a proactive tick on their latest session.

SCOPE: the daemon acts on every student it has RECENT telemetry for (all_students
with a recency window, default 24h). Re-messaging is bounded not by a timer but by
trigger dedup: each (student, session, trigger_type, run_index) fires at most once ever
(agent_triggers UNIQUE), so a student only hears from the agent again when genuinely NEW
behavior trips a trigger. Gated off by default (TRIGGER_DAEMON_ENABLED); when on it
messages real students, so enabling it is a deliberate, authorized act.

BACKOFF (ported from lm-dashboard/app/pipeline/daemon.py): transient tick failures
(prod hiccup, LLM error) get exponential backoff with a UNHEALTHY log after 5 in a
row; idle ticks (nothing acted on, nothing synced) grow the sleep toward
TRIGGER_IDLE_MAX_S so quiet stretches don't hammer prod. The first sign of activity
snaps the interval back to the base. Unlike lm-dashboard (a supervised process), this
is a background thread with no supervisor to restart it, so non-transient errors are
logged and continued rather than re-raised -- a dead thread would silently stop the
push lane until app restart.
