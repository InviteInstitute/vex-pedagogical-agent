"""The single pedagogy pipeline, shared by both lanes.

Reactive (a student typed a message) and proactive (a trigger fired) used to be two
hand-copied sequences. They are the same steps: assemble grounded context (a
deterministic situation model over the session telemetry + the current program), then
one feedback LLM pass. The only differences are the inputs:

  - reactive  passes `student_message` (the real student turn), no `behavior_fact`.
  - proactive passes `behavior_fact` (the neutral trigger fact, NEVER the internal
    label -- design doc §9) and an empty `student_message` (there is no student turn).

`feedback_classes` is decided by each caller (reactive: from the snapshot; proactive:
from the trigger) and passed in.
