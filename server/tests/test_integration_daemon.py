"""End-to-end integration for the push lane (issue #15): daemon -> scope -> generate ->
persist -> SSE-poll delivery, then dedup on a second tick. DB-backed but prod/Ollama-free
(sync and LLM are monkeypatched). Uses fixture_07_1 (12 identical reruns -> wheel_spin;
old events -> inactive). Cleans up."""
