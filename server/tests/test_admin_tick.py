"""Integration test for run_proactive_tick / POST /admin/tick (issue #8).

DB-backed but Ollama-free: the LLM generation is monkeypatched to a canned message,
so this verifies the detect -> persist -> deliver -> mark-acted wiring, not model
quality. Uses fixture_07_1 (12 identical reruns -> a natural wheel_spin). Cleans up.
