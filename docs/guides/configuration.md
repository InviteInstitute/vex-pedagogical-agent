# Configuration

The backend reads all of its configuration from a single gitignored **`.env`** at the
repo root. `docker compose` also reads that same file: it needs `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to
start the `db` service. Copy the example and fill it in.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Where | Default | What It Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `.env` (compose) | (none) | password for the `db` service, compose refuses to start without it |
| `DATABASE_URL` | app | (none) | Postgres connection string. Under compose the API reaches `db` on the compose network. For a venv run point it at the published port `5433` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | app | (none) | key for the LLM gateway. For a local Ollama any non-empty value works (e.g. `ollama`) |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | app | (none) | base URL of the OpenAI-compatible endpoint. UIUC Servers in prod, or `http://localhost:11434/v1` for Ollama |
| `NAVIGATOR_MODEL` | app | (none) | the model name to call, e.g. `gpt-oss-20b` (UIUC Servers) or `llama3.2:latest` (Ollama) |
| `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` | app | `localhost:5173`, `127.0.0.1:5173` | comma-separated allowed client origins (dev only, prod is proxied same-origin by nginx) |
| `INVITE_HUB_BASE_URL` | app | `https://inviteinstitutehub.org` | the Invite Institute Hub, source of the VEX event logs |
| `INVITE_HUB_USERNAME` / `INVITE_HUB_PASSWORD` | app | (none) | Hub credentials for log ingestion, leave empty to run on fixtures only |
| `TRIGGER_DAEMON_ENABLED` | daemon | `false` | arms the proactive daemon. When on, it messages **real** students on a poll, so turning it on is a deliberate act |
| `TRIGGER_POLL_INTERVAL_S` | daemon | `5` | base seconds per tick while activity is flowing |
| `TRIGGER_STUDENT_RECENCY_HOURS` | daemon | `24` | scope the daemon to students with an event in the last N hours, so the first tick doesn't fire `inactive` for every historically idle student |
| `TRIGGER_IDLE_MAX_S` | daemon | `30` | idle-backoff ceiling (how far the poll gap stretches when it's quiet) |
| `TRIGGER_DISABLED` | daemon | (empty) | comma-separated trigger types to detect-but-not-act-on (e.g. `inactive,explorer`), still persisted to `agent_triggers` |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | API | insecure dev default | signs the "this browser solved Turnstile" cookie. Set a long random value in any real deployment or the cookie is forgeable |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET` | API | (none) | Cloudflare Turnstile server-side secret. Unset means the bot gate can't verify anyone |
| `LLM_SESSION_TOKEN_LIMIT` | API | `150000` | LLM tokens one browser session may spend (a session is one Turnstile cookie, 12h). Past it, replies get `429` |
| `LLM_DAILY_TOKEN_LIMIT` | API | `3000000` | LLM tokens all browser sessions together may spend in 24 hours, a ceiling on the worst case |
| `TTS_VOICE` | API | `af_heart` | the Kokoro voice the [Unity avatar](unity-avatar.md) speaks with |
| `TTS_SPEED` | API | `1.0` | the avatar's speaking pace |
| `KOKORO_MODEL` / `KOKORO_VOICES` | API | `server/models/…` | paths to the Kokoro model and voice files (`scripts/fetch_kokoro.py` downloads them) |
| `TRANSCRIBE_MODEL` | API | `gpt-4o-transcribe` | speech-to-text model on the LLM gateway, for the avatar's voice input (e.g. `granite-speech-4.1-2b-plus` on Lumen) |

## Trying Other Models And Prompts

The research preview lets a researcher try any model the gateway serves, edit the prompt
template, and change temperature, max tokens, and the reply trim, without touching
what students get.

1. In the chat panel, switch the footer toggle to **Research** and open the **Agent** tab.
2. Pick a model and edit the settings. They apply to your next message and are saved in
   the browser. Each reply shows the model, the settings, the tokens it spent, and the
   exact prompt sent.

The research view is its own conversation, separate from the student view: switching
the toggle switches chats. Each keeps its own recent turns on the server, so a research
experiment never shows up in the context of a student-view reply, and everything sent
from the research chat is stored with `origin = 'research'` in `chat.messages`, keeping
it out of student data. Proactive check-ins appear in both chats, with their trigger in
the research one, and always use production settings.

### Token budgets

The Agent tab needs no key, so anyone who passes Turnstile could otherwise use the
gateway as a free LLM. What bounds that is a token budget, enforced by the API
(`services/budget.py`):

- Each browser session (one Turnstile cookie, which lasts 12 hours) may spend
  `LLM_SESSION_TOKEN_LIMIT` tokens. A new session needs the challenge solved again.
- All sessions together may spend `LLM_DAILY_TOKEN_LIMIT` tokens in 24 hours.
- Every LLM call a browser triggers counts, research settings or not, including calls
  that fail after spending tokens. Past a limit the reply is a `429` with a plain
  message, and the Agent tab shows how much of the session's budget is used.
- Student messages are capped at 2,000 characters.

Usage is recorded per call in `chat.llm_usage` (a hash of the cookie, never the cookie),
which also shows who spent what on which model. Proactive check-ins are not counted.

To change what students get, edit `PROMPT_TEMPLATE` (and the feedback specs) in
`server/vex_agent/domain/context_builder.py`, or set `NAVIGATOR_MODEL`, and ship it
through a PR. The Agent tab's template editor starts from that live template.

## The LLM Gateway

Feedback runs through any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, set with the three `OPENAI_*` /
`NAVIGATOR_MODEL` variables. Nothing about the pedagogy changes when you swap them.

=== "UIUC Servers (production)"

    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-uiuc-key
    OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.ai.it.ufl.edu/
    NAVIGATOR_MODEL=gpt-oss-20b
    ```

=== "Ollama (local, no cloud)"

    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama
    OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
    NAVIGATOR_MODEL=llama3.2:latest
    ```

!!! tip "Warm-up on boot"
    On startup the API primes the LLM client and the Invite Hub auth token in a
    background thread, so the first student request doesn't pay that cold-start. A
    dependency that's cold at boot never blocks startup.

## The Bot Gate (Turnstile)

There is no student login. The only gate is **Cloudflare Turnstile**, which keeps bots
(not people) off the write API: a browser solves the widget once, and success is
remembered via a signed cookie. `TurnstileGateMiddleware` guards every `/v1/*` route
except the one open verify endpoint (see the [API reference](../reference/api.md)).

- `TURNSTILE_SECRET` is the widget's server-side secret from the Cloudflare dashboard.
- `SESSION_SECRET` signs the "solved the widget" cookie - **set a long random value in
  prod**, or the cookie can be forged.

## The Proactive Daemon

The proactive lane is an in-process background thread, off by default. When
`TRIGGER_DAEMON_ENABLED=true` it wakes every `TRIGGER_POLL_INTERVAL_S` seconds, syncs
new logs, and runs a proactive tick for every in-scope student.

- **Scope** is every student with an event in the last `TRIGGER_STUDENT_RECENCY_HOURS`.
- **Idle backoff**: quiet ticks grow the sleep toward `TRIGGER_IDLE_MAX_S`. The first
  sign of activity snaps it back to the base interval.
- **Dedup**: each `(student, session, trigger_type, run_index)` fires at most once ever
  (a `UNIQUE` on `agent_triggers`), so a student only hears from the agent again on
  genuinely new behavior.

!!! warning "One writer"
    The daemon assumes a **single instance**. It is also the sole owner of the Invite
    Hub ingest cursor (see [Ingestion](ingestion.md)). Run exactly one.

The trigger types and their firing rules live in
[Proactive triggers](../concepts/proactive-triggers.md).
